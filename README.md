Making an ordinary mini fan from Amazon into a work of art
A project by me, cervidwithmoped.

## Foreword
This is my first proper write-up on GitHub! While I plan on structuring this report like a scientific paper, don't expect any formalities. This was just a fun little project I did in free time that I'm just now deciding to write about and post. Also, I'm a human. Who wrote this. Because I wanted to. 

__None__ of what you are about to read (nor the files I have added to this repo) were created with AI. Now that's out of the way, shall we begin?

## Introduction
As defined by Wikipedia, the furry fandom "is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic characters", and many people in the furry fandom own "fursuits" (sorta like the costumes that you see mascots at sporting events wear, except completely custom-made). I'm a furry, and plenty of my friends are as well. If you've never heard of us, well, now you have.

In January 2024, a friend of mine tweeted about wanting a fursuit mouth fan in the shape of a carrot (after all, his "fursona" is a hare, so a carrot fan would be both fitting and functional for him and his future fursuit). After a while, fursuiting can become incredibly taxing on the wearer, and there have been plenty of documented cases of fursuiters passing out due to heat stroke, especially at furry conventions. Nowadays, many fursuiters opt to bring a mini fan -- with a footprint not that much larger than a smartphone -- that they can wear on their necks to be able to cool them off.

I wanted to surprise my friend with a carrot-shaped fursuit fan, so I took the tweet as a challenge!
